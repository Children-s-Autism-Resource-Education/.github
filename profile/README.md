# CARE Develoment Project
We also have a readme for each component of this project that provided details on how others may replicate our steps (on MD how you can build the application, on ML how to train the model and save it, and on CC how to run the api on local or deploy it on GCP)

# **Project Background:** 

Indonesia faces significant challenges due to the rising prevalence of autism. Deputy Health Minister Dr. Dante Saksono Harbuwono estimates there are 2.4 million children on the autism spectrum in Indonesia. With a birth rate of 4.5 million annually, 1 in 100 children is diagnosed with autism, according to pediatrician Dr. Bernie Endyarni Medise, SpA(K), MPH. Limited information, access to specialized services, societal stigma, and economic barriers hinder parents from consulting experts (The Lancet Psychiatry, 2019). Rapid innovations in hardware and software multimedia technologies enable many techniques for detecting the existence of this disease in children (S, Guruvammal.2022). CARE addresses this by helping parents detect early signs of autism and understand their child's daily emotional state through facial pattern recognition. The app also provides accessible information and expert recommendations for effective treatments. With around 194 million smartphone users in Indonesia, CARE offers a significant opportunity to support children with autism. By leveraging technology, CARE aims to improve the quality of life for children with autism and their families in Indonesia. Here's what we've done for each member of the learning path:

1. Machine Learning: We focus on supervised learning for image classification using TensorFlow.Js models and CNNs. The first case is emotion detection with multi-class labels, and the second is autism detection in children with binary labels. Both cases compare CNNs to several pre-trained and fine-tuned models.
2. Mobile Development: Develop the app using Android Studio and Kotlin, leveraging libraries like Retrofit for API connectivity and Glide for image handling. We implement Android Jetpack Compose for a modern, easy-to-understand interface with a declarative UI.
3. Cloud Computing: Using Node.js as the back-end programming language. In addition, we use several services in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) such as Cloud Storage to store object type data and machine learning models, Cloud SQL to store data from applications such as user data, etc., and Cloud Firestore to store prediction results from machine learning models. We use Cloud Run to deploy the back-end.
